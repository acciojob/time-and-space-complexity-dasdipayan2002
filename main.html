	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		So, the Time Complexity is the number of operations an algorithm 
		performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes 
		the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs 
		the task in the smallest number of operations is 
		considered the most efficient one in terms of the Time Complexity.
	</p>
	<p>
		It measures the total amount of temporary or 
		permanent storage space needed by an algorithm as a 
		function of the input size. 
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is also expressed in Big O notation 
		(e.g., O(1), O(n), O(n^2))
