    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        The term 'Time complexity' is used to describe the number of operations an algorithm 
        performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes 
        the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs 
        the task in the smallest number of operations is 
        considered the most efficient one.
    </p>
    <p>
        'Space Complexity' is a measure of the total amount of temporary or 
        permanent storage space needed by an algorithm as a 
        function of the size of the input. 
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is also expressed in Big O notation 
        (e.g., O(n), O(n^2)).
